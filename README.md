Product users: 
Our intented users are between the ages of 13-35 who are interested in sharing their thoughts with their followers, and keep up to date instantly with the posts from others. 

MVP (essential features):
Our MVP will consist of users being able to create and delete their own posts. User profiles will have a login and will be able to engage by liking, following, and commenting on posts. 

Functionality: 
As an online user, this application will allow you to share your thoughts instantly with all your followers. You will be able to interact with all other users on the platform, by following each other, liking each other's posts, and commenting on them. We hope this product will be a unique platform for users to interact from around the world, allowing them to broaden their scope of interactions, knowledge and ideas.

Here are a couple of examples of what creating and commenting on a post will look like:

Issues:
The first issue we ran into was that one of the contributors was unable to push code onto their github. We kept getting the following error: "Error Code 403 fatal: HTTP request failed." Despite searching online for a solution and trying several, we couldn't get the error to go away. We're working to fix it this week.
Second issue was a bug we encountered in step 7 of the tutorial. We had trouble establishing relationships between our models, more specifically, between the User and the Relationship models. 

Installation steps:
#TODO: revisit this once we have a complete product
To install our application, download the entire repo and start the server in terminal from the directory where the code is stored.
